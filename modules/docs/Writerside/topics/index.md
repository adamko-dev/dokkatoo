# Dokkatoo Documentation

Welcome to the documentation website for Dokkatoo,

Dokkatoo is a Gradle plugin that generates documentation
for your Kotlin projects.

Dokkatoo uses [Dokka](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka/), the API documentation engine for Kotlin,
to generate API reference documentation from source code.

###### Why Dokkatoo?

If
[Dokka already has a Gradle plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/dokka-gradle.html),
then what is Dokkatoo for?

Dokkatoo has a number of improvements over the existing Dokka Gradle Plugin:

* Compatible with [Gradle Build Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html)
* Compatible with
  [Gradle Configuration Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/configuration_cache.html)
* Follows Gradle best practices for plugin development, for a more stable experience
* Faster, parallel execution


#### What can Dokkatoo do?

* [https://docs.gradle.org/current/kotlin-dsl/](https://docs.gradle.org/current/kotlin-dsl/)
* [https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/kdoc/](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/kdoc/)

### Status

Dokkatoo is used in production by many projects, and can generate documentation for single-module
and multimodule projects.

[Dokkatoo has been merged into the Dokka codebase](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka/pull/3188),
although as of December 2023 it has not been released.
Until JetBrains releases a version of Dokkatoo, continue to use this version and
[watch this space](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka/issues/3131).

#### Snapshot releases

Snapshot versions of Dokkatoo are available on
[Maven Central](https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/dev/adamko/dokkatoo/dokkatoo-plugin/).
